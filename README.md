As a data science and business analytics intern at the Sparks foundation.
I had perform some Tasks given to me in the internship duration.

Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML.
This model is a simple linear regression model, with two features, hours and score. It predicts your score on the basis of how many hours a day you studied. To predict a score, use lm.predict() and enter the value of feature(hours) as a numeric value. Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised Machine learning algorithm
Objective - To perform Simple K-means clustering on Dataset given (iris) ideal number of clusters and represent it visually.
clusters found =3

Task 3- Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset 'Superstore.csv' This code uses plotly and cufflinks for an interactive data analysis of the given csv file - 'SampleSuperstore.csv'
